In the chapter "Game Tree Searching by Min / Max Approximation" the author, Ronald L. Rivest, present an iterative method for searching game trees by
approximating the “min” and “max” operators. The approximation determine the next leaf node to expand. The results are drawn from playing 1000 games of 'Connect-Four’
and finding that used scheme is superior to minmax search with alpha-beta pruning, although this scheme has more CPU overhead.
